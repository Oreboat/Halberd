# Halberd

Halberd is an open source Entity Component System based game engine built in the Zig programming Language

## Why ECS
Entity Component System, or ECS for short, provides a simple, modular approach to game design using the principles of Data Oriented design principles. ECS also provides a way of keeping data stored in the CPU's Cache rather then constantly requesting data from RAM. As such, when done correctly ECS can provide many optimizations over the traditional approach of Object Oriented Design.

## Requirements
Zig 0.14.0

## Downloading
to download Halberd you can use

`git clone https://github.com/Normal-Sink-Studio/Mordred-Engine.git`

and then simply build it

## Building
Halberd can be build quite simpily using the command "zig build" and it can be build with the intention to run using "zig build run" that's it, no special commands, no makefiles, just a regular build
